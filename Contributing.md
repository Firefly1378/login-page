Contributing Guidelines üìú
If you are new to open-source and would like to make your first contribution, please participate in this project.

Follow the steps below :-

Git Setup Guide
To initialise Git, write
git init
1. Configure your local Git
git config --global user.name "github username"
git config --global user.email "email address"
2. Go to the first-contribution repository and Fork it.
The term fork refers to a rough copy of a repository. When you fork a repository, you are able to test and debug changes without affecting the original project. In addition to proposing changes to resolve bugs, forking is also used excessively for this purpose.

Click on Code Button and copy the URL of your forked Repository

3. Switch to your Git bash window, and enter the following :
Clone the Forked project on your local system
git clone https://github.com/eduardconstantin/Comic-book-button-anim.git
Note: Do not fill this detail twice or more than that.

4. Creating a Pull request
Create a branch
A branch is designed to encapsulate a group of changes. These changes might be thrown away, entirely rewritten or in the majority of cases they‚Äôll be promoted into the main history of the codebase - via a merge.

For creating a branch

git branch branch_name
Checkout to the created branch
git checkout branch_name
Now add the files using the git command
git add .
Commit the changes to the local project
git commit -m "Added my data"
Push the changes to your forked github repo
git push origin branch_name
5. Final Steps
Open your forked git repository, you will get a message like as shown in the figure (if not then refresh the page).
